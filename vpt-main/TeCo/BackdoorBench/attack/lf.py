this script is for lf attack

The original license is placed at the end of this file.

basic structure:
1. config args, save_path, fix random seed
2. set the clean train data and clean test data
3. set the attack img transform and label transform
4. set the backdoor attack data and backdoor test data
5. set the device, model, criterion, optimizer, training schedule.
6. attack or use the model to do finetune with 5% clean data
7. save the attack result for defense
